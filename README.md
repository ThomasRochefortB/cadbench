## Getting Started

1.  **Set up the environment and install dependencies:**

    First, ensure you have `uv` installed (see [uv's installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)).

    Then, create a virtual environment using Python 3.12+ and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., with Python 3.12)
    uv venv .venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies from pyproject.toml and sync with uv.lock
    uv sync
    ```

    If you modify `pyproject.toml` (e.g., add a new dependency), run:
    ```bash
    uv lock
    uv sync
    ```
    to update `uv.lock` and your environment.

2.  **Set your API Keys (required):**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # Required for OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo)
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # Required for Claude models
    GEMINI_API_KEY="..."  # Required for Google Gemini models
    ```

    **Important**: API keys are required. Without the corresponding API keys, the models will fail to generate CAD scripts.

3.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to use CADBench.

## Features

- **Head-to-Head LLM Comparison**: Compare how different LLMs generate CAD models for the same prompt
- **Supported Models**:
  - OpenAI: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, o1, o3, o4-mini
  - Anthropic: 
    - Claude 3.7: Claude 3.7 Sonnet
    - Claude 3.5: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (v1 and v2), Claude 3.5 Haiku
    - Claude 3: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku
  - Google: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Side-by-Side Visualization**: See the 3D models generated by each LLM right next to each other
- **FreeCAD Integration**: Generated scripts are executed to create actual CAD models

## FreeCAD Integration

For CADBench to execute the generated Python scripts and produce `.FCStd` files, Docker must be installed and running.

*   **Docker (Required):**
    This app uses Docker to run FreeCAD in a consistent and isolated environment.

    1.  **Ensure Docker is installed and running:**
        ```bash
        docker --version
        ```

    2.  **Pull the FreeCAD Docker image:**
        ```bash
        docker pull linuxserver/freecad:0.20.2
        ```

**FreeCAD Integration:**

If FreeCAD is installed and `freecadcmd` (or `FreeCADCmd`) is available on your system's PATH, the generated Python script will be executed by the backend. The resulting `.FCStd` file will then be available for download from the web interface. Otherwise, only the script itself will be displayed.

## Installing FreeCAD

For CADBench to execute the generated Python scripts and produce `.FCStd` files, FreeCAD (specifically `freecadcmd` or `FreeCADCmd`) must be accessible to the `app.py` environment.

The recommended and supported method for running FreeCAD with CADBench is via a Docker container.

*   **Docker (Recommended):**
    Running FreeCAD in a Docker container provides a consistent and isolated environment. You will need to ensure that the `app.py` script (or the environment it runs in) can interact with this Docker container to execute `freecadcmd`.

    1.  **Pull a FreeCAD Docker Image:**
        You can use official or community-provided FreeCAD Docker images. The recommended image which includes `freecadcmd` is `linuxserver/freecad:0.20.2`.
        ```bash
        docker pull linuxserver/freecad:0.20.2
        ```
        For other options, refer to the [FreeCAD Compile on Docker documentation](https://wiki.freecad.org/Compile_on_Docker) and Docker Hub.

    2.  **Running `freecadcmd` via Docker:**
        The `try_execute_freecad_script` function in `app.py` currently uses `shutil.which` to find `freecadcmd` directly on the system PATH. To use Docker, this function would need to be modified to execute `freecadcmd` *inside* a Docker container. This typically involves:
        *   Mounting the temporary directory (containing `gen.py` and for `output.FCStd`) into the Docker container.
        *   Running a `docker run ... <freecad-image> freecadcmd /path/to/gen.py` command.
        *   Retrieving `output.FCStd` from the mounted volume.

    **Note:** The current version of `app.py` does **not** have built-in support for executing `freecadcmd` via Docker. This would be a necessary modification to strictly enforce Docker-only FreeCAD usage for script execution.

Alternatively, if you are developing locally and have `freecadcmd` on your PATH (from a direct install), `app.py` will attempt to use it. However, for reproducible or deployed environments, a Docker-based approach for FreeCAD is advised for future development.
